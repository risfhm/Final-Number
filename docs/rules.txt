    - A game of chance of choices.
    
      - It is necessary to choose 2 values only.
    
      - One of these values will be the final number and the other will be the subtractor number.
    
      - There will be a list of numbers, where one of them will be chosen at random.
    
      - The random number chosen from this list will be subtracted by the value
        chosen from number subtractor
    
      - The result that will come from this operation must be equal to the final chosen number,
        being the element that determines the game, hence the name "final number".
