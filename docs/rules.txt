- What is Final Number?
  
  > Final Number is a game of choices based on luck and logic, 
    the game has three main elements: Random Number, Final Number, 
    and a Subtractor. 


- How this game works?

  > The main objective of this game is to find the Final Number from
    the Random Number and Subtractor. In short, the Final Number is the 
    result of subtracting the Random Number and Subtractor from this numerical 
    expression -> [random - sub = final_number]. There is a system of modes, 
    difficulty and levels to turn the game into something more challenging and 
    dynamic. Below is an explanation of each system:


    >>  Modes: there are two game modes (Casual Mode and Extreme Mode). The difference 
        between them is the jump (the jump is a number that will be incremented to the 
        initial value until reaching the last level) between each level.

          - Casual Mode: 2 (jump)
          - Extreme Mode: 10 (jump)


    >>  Levels: the game is divided into 5 levels that vary according to a jump defined 
        by the game mode, on each level the MAX value (the maximum number in the range 1 to MAX) 
        is incremented with the value of the jump defined by the chosen mode (Casual or Extreme).


    >>  Difficulty: the difficulty system (Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard) defines the amount of 
        attempts the user has for each level.

          - Easy: 5 
          - Normal: 3
          - Very: 2
          - Very Hard: 1


    >> Value Characteristics:

      - The Random Number value is generated according to the MAX value at each level, then the 
        MAX is incremented and a new value for Random is generated.

      - The Final Number value cannot be less than or equal to zero and also must not be greater 
        than the current MAX of the round.

      - The value of the Subtractor can be negative and does not have the restrictions of the 
        Final Number.

      - The MAX value always changes according to the jump when the player advances levels and
        consequently the value of the Random Number.


- Additional software information

  > The game includes a colorization system for the displayed content, so it is easy to understand
    the information information on the screen.

  > There is a final report generation system at the end of the game (reaching level 5 and winning it)
    that integrates the main data of your game: game mode, difficulty, number of failures to win the
    game, and more.

  > The number of failures in the final report defines the amount of wrong moves a certain player faced
    until he won the game (this amount is cumulative from the moment the player started playing and not 
    restarting after a Gamer Over)

  > There is a naming and swapping system in the game where a player can choose any name to be represented 
    during the game in the necessary reports and messages.If you want to learn more about this feature, go
